  <h3><b>About the developer</b></h3>
  <p>Hi all! My name is Michael.</p>
  <p>I canâ€™t boast of many years of experience in coding; in some ways, this is my debut project.</p>
  <p>In 2016, I entered Tyumen State University and studied at the Department of Information Systems and Technologies. 
    In 2020, I graduated from the university and received a bachelor's degree. At the same time, 
    I am working on the largest project in my life - it was a CRM for a large oil and gas producing company. Once ready, 
    it was planned to implement this CRM into the enterprise system.
    The essence of the project was to work with drilling schedules, which were previously stored in Excel format - 
    the service had to accept such files with a lot of data and transform them into diagrams, 
    allowing them to be dynamically worked with, interacting with employees from other departments. 
    A role model was developed specifically for this purpose.</p>
  <p>However, having completed the work, I did not go further to develop in the field - I went into sports, 
    which I had been doing since I was 15 years old. At the moment, I have long wanted to change the area for development, 
    which is why I took on this project (to catch up with the old, learn new things and develop further).</p>
  <p>As far as possible and willing, I will continue to improve this service. Don't judge harshly and good luck to you!</p>
